The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you're trying to access data from a listener before the listener has fired or if you're using a Promise to get the data but haven't properly handled the asynchronous nature of the operation. For example, if you directly try to access the data in the `onSnapshot` callback without waiting for the data to fully load. This often leads to `undefined` values or unexpected behavior.  Another unusual issue is when using transactions with multiple writes, failing to handle concurrency errors appropriately.  If two transactions attempt to modify the same data simultaneously, one may fail silently or lead to unpredictable state.

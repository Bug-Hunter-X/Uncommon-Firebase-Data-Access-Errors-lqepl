To prevent accessing snapshot data before it is fully populated, always handle the asynchronous nature of the operations. For example, ensure you access the data within the callback of an asynchronous function such as the callback provided by `onSnapshot`. 

To prevent concurrency issues in transactions, use appropriate error handling within transaction callbacks to catch and handle exceptions. Use retry logic if necessary.  Consider using optimistic locking techniques to track concurrent modifications.  If you need to read data before performing a write in a transaction, consider including a read in the transaction itself for atomicity.

Here's an example of how to safely access data from a snapshot:
```javascript
import { doc, getDoc, onSnapshot } from 'firebase/firestore'

// ... Firebase initialization

const docRef = doc(db, 'collection', 'docId');

onSnapshot(docRef, (snapshot) => {
  if (snapshot.exists()) {
    const data = snapshot.data();
    console.log('Data:', data);
  } else {
    console.log('No such document!');
  }
});
```
And an example of more robust transaction handling:
```javascript
import { getFirestore, runTransaction } from 'firebase/firestore';

const db = getFirestore();

runTransaction(db, async (transaction) => {
  // ... get data from transaction 
  try{
    //Perform your operations
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
    //Handle error appropriately, potentially retrying
  }
});
```
